# Add Feature Command Specification

## Overview
The `@addFeature` command is used to add new features to the Electric Vehicle Data Hub application. This command ensures that all feature references are systematically added to the project specifications, task list, and agent documentation, maintaining project consistency and enabling proper feature development planning.

## What This Command Does

The `@addFeature` command is executed by an AI agent from within Cursor IDE to add a new feature to the Electric Vehicle Data Hub application. When this command is invoked, the agent will:

1. **Ask for Feature Details**: The agent will prompt you to provide:
   - **Feature Name**: A descriptive name for the new feature
   - **Priority Level**: Whether this is HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW priority
   - **Complexity**: How complex the feature is (Simple, Moderate, or Complex)
   - **Description**: A brief explanation of what the feature does and why it's needed

2. **Update Project Documentation**: The agent will automatically:
   - Add the feature to the Project Requirements Document (PRD.md)
   - Update the Technical Specification (TECHNICAL_SPEC.md) with technical requirements
   - Update the User Interface Specification (USER_INTERFACE_SPEC.md) with UI/UX requirements

3. **Create Development Tasks**: The agent will:
   - Break down the feature into manageable 4-hour development tasks
   - Add these tasks to the project task list (taskList.md)
   - Set appropriate priorities and dependencies for each task

4. **Update Agent Documentation**: The agent will:
   - Update the Boss Agent and Project Manager Agent documentation
   - Add feature-specific responsibilities and workflows
   - Ensure all agents understand how to work with the new feature

## Command Purpose
This command performs a comprehensive addition of a feature to the application by:
1. Adding feature references to PRD.md
2. Updating TECHNICAL_SPEC.md with technical requirements
3. Updating USER_INTERFACE_SPEC.md with UI/UX requirements
4. Creating related tasks in taskList.md
5. Updating agent documentation to include feature-specific responsibilities

## Task Creation Guidelines

### Task Breakdown Strategy
- **Large Features**: Break down into multiple 4-hour tasks
- **Complex Components**: Split into smaller, focused implementation tasks
- **Integration Work**: Separate into discrete, testable units
- **UI Components**: Create individual components as separate tasks
- **Data Management**: Split data fetching, processing, and display into separate tasks

### Task Sizing Requirements
- **All Tasks**: Must be completable in 4 hours (half a day)
- **Component Creation**: 1 component per 4-hour task
- **Data Integration**: Separate data fetching from display logic
- **UI Styling**: Include styling and responsiveness in component tasks
- **Testing**: Include basic testing and validation in each task

### Priority Assignment
- **HIGH**: Core functionality, user-facing features, performance-critical features
- **MEDIUM**: Supporting features, enhancement features, quality-of-life improvements
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have features, experimental features, future enhancements

## Validation Requirements

### Post-Addition Validation
1. **Reference Check**: All feature references are properly added
2. **Documentation Consistency**: All specifications remain internally consistent
3. **Task Dependencies**: All task dependencies are properly mapped
4. **Agent Workflows**: Agent documentation remains functional
5. **Project Scope**: Project scope is appropriately expanded

### Quality Assurance
1. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Check for proper linking between documents
2. **Formatting Consistency**: Maintain consistent document formatting
3. **Content Flow**: Ensure document flow remains logical
4. **Version Control**: Update document version numbers if applicable

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Feature Already Exists**: Verify feature name and check for duplicates
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Identify and document feature dependencies
3. **Incomplete Documentation**: Ensure all required sections are completed
4. **Task Creation Issues**: Validate task breakdown and sizing

### Conflict Resolution
- **Naming Conflicts**: Resolve any naming conflicts with existing features
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Ensure new feature doesn't break existing functionality
- **Resource Conflicts**: Validate resource requirements and availability
