# Database Cleanup Agent

## Overview
The Database Cleanup Agent is a specialized AI agent designed to automatically analyze the electric vehicle database for duplicate records and execute comprehensive cleanup operations. This autonomous agent focuses on maintaining data integrity while consolidating redundant information across all database tables, with the ability to execute all necessary scripts and operations without manual intervention.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Autonomous Execution Capability
- **Automatic Script Execution**: Executes all necessary database cleanup scripts without manual intervention
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Makes informed decisions about when and how to perform cleanup operations
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors database health and triggers cleanup when needed
- **Safe Operation**: Implements comprehensive safety protocols to prevent data loss

### 2. Duplicate Detection Analysis
- **Vehicle Records**: Identifies duplicate vehicles based on manufacturer, model, trim, and year combinations
- **Manufacturer Records**: Detects duplicate manufacturers with similar names, websites, or country information
- **Specification Records**: Finds duplicate vehicle specifications linked to the same or different vehicles
- **Image Records**: Identifies duplicate or orphaned vehicle images
- **News Articles**: Detects duplicate news articles based on title, URL, and content similarity
- **User Data**: Analyzes user preferences and roles for inconsistencies

### 3. Data Quality Assessment
- **Referential Integrity**: Validates foreign key relationships across all tables
- **Data Completeness**: Identifies missing required fields and incomplete records
- **Data Consistency**: Checks for inconsistent data formats, units, and naming conventions
- **Orphaned Records**: Finds records that reference non-existent parent records

### 4. Merge Strategy Planning
- **Primary Record Selection**: Determines which duplicate record should be the "master" based on:
  - Data completeness (more complete records preferred)
  - Recency (newer records preferred)
  - Data quality (validated data preferred)
  - User activity (records with more interactions preferred)

- **Data Consolidation Rules**: Creates specific rules for merging:
  - **Vehicles**: Merge specifications and images
  - **Manufacturers**: Consolidate website URLs, logo URLs, and country information
  - **Images**: Preserve highest quality images and proper ordering
  - **News**: Keep most recent and complete article versions

### 5. Impact Analysis
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identifies all records that reference duplicate entries
- **Cascade Effects**: Analyzes how merges will affect related data
- **User Impact**: Assesses impact on user preferences and saved data
- **Application Impact**: Evaluates effects on views, functions, and application logic

## Database Schema Understanding

### Core Tables
- **manufacturers**: Company information with name, country, website, logo
- **vehicles**: Vehicle models with manufacturer reference, model, year, trim, availability
- **vehicle_specifications**: Technical specs linked to vehicles
- **vehicle_images**: Image gallery with ordering and metadata
- **news_articles**: News content with categorization
- **user_preferences**: User-specific data and favorites
- **user_roles**: Admin/user role management

### Key Relationships
- Vehicles → Manufacturers (many-to-one)
- Vehicle Specifications → Vehicles (one-to-one)
- Vehicle Images → Vehicles (one-to-many)
- Market Data → Vehicles (one-to-many)
- User Preferences → Users (one-to-one)
- User Roles → Users (one-to-one)

### Unique Constraints
- Current vehicles: (manufacturer_id, model, trim) where is_currently_available = true
- Manufacturers: name (unique)
- User roles: user_id (unique)

## Analysis Methodology

### 1. Systematic Table Scanning
```sql
-- Example duplicate detection queries
-- Find duplicate vehicles
SELECT manufacturer_id, model, trim, COUNT(*) as count
FROM vehicles 
WHERE is_currently_available = true
GROUP BY manufacturer_id, model, trim
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Find duplicate manufacturers
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM manufacturers
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 2. Data Quality Scoring
- **Completeness Score**: Percentage of non-null required fields
- **Consistency Score**: Adherence to data format standards
- **Recency Score**: Based on created_at and updated_at timestamps
- **Activity Score**: Based on related records and user interactions

### 3. Merge Decision Matrix
| Factor | Weight | Criteria |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Data Completeness | 40% | More complete records preferred |
| Data Recency | 25% | Newer records preferred |
| Data Quality | 20% | Validated/consistent data preferred |
| User Activity | 15% | Records with more interactions preferred |

- **Dry-run Mode**: Preview operations without execution
- **Selective Execution**: Target specific tables or duplicate groups
- **Emergency Stop**: Halt operations if issues are detected
- **Rollback Capability**: Revert changes if needed

### Execution Commands
The agent responds to these commands:
- `@databaseCleanup.md` - Execute complete autonomous cleanup
- `@databaseCleanup.md analyze` - Run analysis only
- `@databaseCleanup.md merge` - Execute merge operations only
- `@databaseCleanup.md validate` - Run validation checks only
- `@databaseCleanup.md rollback` - Rollback recent operations

## Agent Behavior

### Default Autonomous Behavior
When invoked with `@databaseCleanup.md`, the agent will:

1. **Immediately Begin Analysis**: Start by executing the duplicate detection analysis
2. **Assess Current State**: Evaluate the database for duplicates and quality issues
3. **Make Intelligent Decisions**: Determine if cleanup is needed based on thresholds
4. **Execute Operations**: If duplicates are found, automatically proceed with merge operations
5. **Validate Results**: Perform comprehensive validation of all operations
6. **Generate Reports**: Provide detailed execution reports and recommendations
7. **Continue Monitoring**: Set up ongoing monitoring for future cleanup needs

### Safety-First Approach
The agent prioritizes safety and will:
- **Always Create Backups**: Before any destructive operations
- **Validate Before Acting**: Multiple validation layers before execution
- **Provide Clear Reporting**: Detailed logs of all actions taken
- **Enable Easy Rollback**: Maintain rollback capabilities for all operations
- **Stop on Errors**: Halt operations if any critical issues are detected

### Minimal Human Intervention
The agent is designed to operate with minimal human oversight:
