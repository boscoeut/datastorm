# Current Models Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to focus the Electric Vehicle Data Hub on current models only, removing year-based tracking and historical model data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **New Migration**: `005_current_models_only.sql`
  - Added `is_currently_available` boolean field to vehicles table
  - Added `model_year` field for reference purposes only
  - Removed year-based unique constraint
  - Added new unique constraint for current models only
  - Created database views for current vehicles
  - Updated RLS policies

### 2. TypeScript Type Updates
- **File**: `web/src/types/database.ts`
  - Updated `Vehicle` interface to include `is_currently_available` field
  - Added `CurrentVehicle` type for type safety
  - Removed year-based filters from `VehicleFilters` interface
  - Added `is_currently_available` filter option

### 3. Database Service Updates
- **File**: `web/src/services/database.ts`
  - Updated `VehicleService.list()` to default to current vehicles only
  - Updated `VehicleService.getWithDetails()` to filter current vehicles
  - Updated `VehicleService.search()` to default to current vehicles
  - Added `VehicleService.getCurrentVehicles()` method

### 4. UI Component Updates

#### VehicleList Component
- **File**: `web/src/components/vehicles/VehicleList.tsx`
  - Removed year column from vehicle table
  - Kept body style column (moved to replace year column)

#### VehicleDetail Component
- **File**: `web/src/components/vehicles/VehicleDetail.tsx`
  - Removed year badge from vehicle header
  - Added "Current Model" badge instead
  - Maintained body style and electric type badges

#### VehicleComparison Component
- **File**: `web/src/components/vehicles/VehicleComparison.tsx`
  - Removed year display from comparison headers
  - Added "Current Model" text to vehicle descriptions

#### VehicleSearch Component
- **File**: `web/src/components/vehicles/VehicleSearch.tsx`
  - Removed year range filters (year_min, year_max)
  - Replaced with body style filter
  - Maintained manufacturer and other filters

### 5. State Management Updates
- **File**: `web/src/stores/vehicle-store.ts`
  - Updated initial filters to include `is_currently_available: true`
  - Modified `fetchVehicles()` to use search method with current vehicle filtering

### 6. Documentation Updates
- **File**: `docs/specs/PRD.md`
  - Updated Vehicle Database section to emphasize "Current EV Catalog"
  - Clarified focus on currently available models only
  - Updated data requirements to reflect current model focus

- **File**: `docs/specs/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`
  - Updated Vehicle interface in data models
  - Added comments explaining year field usage

## Key Benefits

1. **Simplified Data Model**: No more year-based tracking complexity
2. **Current Focus**: Application now focuses on what's available today
3. **Cleaner UI**: Removed year prefixes from vehicle names (e.g., "Tesla Model Y" instead of "2024 Tesla Model Y")
4. **Better User Experience**: Users see current models without historical clutter
5. **Maintainable**: Easier to manage and update vehicle data

## Database Views Created

1. **`current_vehicles`**: Shows only currently available vehicles with manufacturer details
2. **`current_vehicles_with_specs`**: Shows current vehicles with their specifications

## Migration Notes

- Existing vehicles are marked as `is_currently_available = true` by default
- Year field is kept for reference but not used for uniqueness
- New unique constraint prevents duplicate current models
- RLS policies updated to work with current vehicle views

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify that only current vehicles are displayed in the vehicle list
2. Check that vehicle detail pages show "Current Model" instead of year
3. Confirm that search and filtering work with current vehicles only
4. Test vehicle comparison functionality with current models
5. Verify database views return correct data

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding a "Model Year" field for reference if needed
- May want to add functionality to mark vehicles as discontinued
- Could add version tracking for model updates within the same model name
