3. [ ] Check for console errors and performance issues
4. [ ] Validate against PRD requirements and TECHNICAL_SPEC guidelines
5. [ ] Ensure performance meets PRD success metrics (< 1 second load time)

### Phase 6: Final Review
1. [ ] Code review and cleanup following TECHNICAL_SPEC code quality standards
2. [ ] Remove console.logs and debug code
3. [ ] Optimize performance to meet PRD success metrics
4. [ ] Update documentation if required
5. [ ] Verify alignment with PRD objectives and TECHNICAL_SPEC architecture

## Files to Modify/Create
- [ ] `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` - Main application layout wrapper following TECHNICAL_SPEC project structure

- [ ] `src/types/layout.ts` - Layout-related TypeScript interfaces following TECHNICAL_SPEC project structure

## Dependencies to Add
- [ ] `react-router-dom` - ^6.20.0 - Client-side routing for navigation following approved tech stack in TECHNICAL_SPEC
- [ ] `@radix-ui/react-navigation-menu` - ^1.1.4 - Accessible navigation components following TECHNICAL_SPEC accessibility guidelines
- [ ] `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` - ^1.0.3 - Collapsible sidebar functionality following TECHNICAL_SPEC accessibility guidelines

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Layout renders correctly on all screen sizes - must meet TECHNICAL_SPEC testing coverage requirements
- [ ] Navigation menu works on desktop and mobile - must meet TECHNICAL_SPEC testing coverage requirements
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints function properly - must meet TECHNICAL_SPEC testing coverage requirements
- [ ] Cross-browser testing - follow TECHNICAL_SPEC browser compatibility
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness - meet PRD mobile optimization requirements
- [ ] Performance testing - ensure PRD success metrics are met (< 1 second load time)
- [ ] Accessibility testing - verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for navigation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Main application layout renders without errors and provides intuitive navigation - specific and measurable, aligned with PRD objectives
- [ ] Layout is fully responsive and works on all device sizes - specific and measurable, aligned with PRD objectives
- [ ] Navigation supports all main application sections (Vehicle Database, Market Data, News) - specific and measurable, aligned with PRD objectives
- [ ] Performance criteria - Layout loads in < 1 second to meet PRD success metrics
- [ ] Accessibility criteria - Navigation meets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements

## Notes and Considerations
- The layout must support the data-centric design philosophy outlined in PRD Section 4.1
- Navigation should be designed to support the information architecture requirements in PRD Section 4.2
- Mobile-first responsive design is critical as specified in PRD Section 4.3
- Layout components should follow the component architecture patterns in TECHNICAL_SPEC Section 2.2
- Performance optimization is crucial to meet the < 3 second page load requirement in PRD Section 5.3
- Accessibility must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards as specified in TECHNICAL_SPEC Section 10

## Example Usage
```tsx
// Main App component using the layout
import { AppLayout } from './components/layout/AppLayout';

function App() {
  return (
    <AppLayout>
      <Header />
      <div className="flex">
        <Sidebar />
        <MainContent>
          {/* Route-based content will be rendered here */}
        </MainContent>
      </div>
      <Footer />
    </AppLayout>
  );
}

// Navigation component example
<Navigation>
  <NavigationItem href="/vehicles">Vehicle Database</NavigationItem>
  <NavigationItem href="/market">Market Data</NavigationItem>
  <NavigationItem href="/news">Industry News</NavigationItem>
</Navigation>
```
