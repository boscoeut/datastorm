# Task: Implement Vehicle Detail Component

**Created:** 2024-01-15
**Priority:** HIGH
**Complexity:** Half-Day (4 hours)
**Phase:** Phase 1
**Status:** Completed
**Dependencies:** Task 1.1 - Implement Vehicle List Component

## Task Description
Create the VehicleDetail component that displays comprehensive vehicle specifications and information for individual vehicles. This component will be accessed from the vehicle list and provide users with detailed technical specifications, performance metrics, and complete vehicle information in a well-organized, mobile-responsive format.

This task focuses specifically on the vehicle detail display functionality - creating a comprehensive specification view that integrates with existing database services, follows the established design system, and provides detailed vehicle information that supports the PRD's data-centric approach. The component must handle vehicle data loading, error states, and provide an excellent user experience across all device sizes.

1. [ ] Apply consistent styling using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
2. [ ] Ensure responsive design for detailed data presentation
3. [ ] Add proper spacing and visual hierarchy for specifications
4. [ ] Implement accessibility features (heading structure, ARIA labels)

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation (15 minutes)
1. [ ] Test functionality across different screen sizes
2. [ ] Verify navigation between list and detail works correctly
3. [ ] Check for console errors and performance issues
4. [ ] Validate against PRD requirements and accessibility standards

### Phase 6: Final Review (15 minutes)
1. [ ] Code review and cleanup following project standards
2. [ ] Remove debug code and console.logs
3. [ ] Optimize performance to meet PRD requirements
4. [ ] Verify alignment with design system and technical specifications

## Files to Modify/Create
**Maximum 2 files per 4-hour task:**
- [ ] `src/components/vehicles/VehicleDetail.tsx` - Main vehicle detail component
- [ ] `src/App.tsx` - Add vehicle detail route and update navigation

## Dependencies to Add
- [ ] No new dependencies required - using existing approved tech stack

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Vehicle detail data displays correctly with organized sections
- [ ] Navigation from vehicle list to detail pages works seamlessly
- [ ] Loading states and error handling function properly
- [ ] Component is mobile-responsive with readable data presentation
- [ ] No console errors or warnings during normal operation
- [ ] Performance meets PRD requirements (< 3s load time)
- [ ] Accessibility features work correctly (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Integration with existing layout and theme system works seamlessly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] VehicleDetail component displays comprehensive vehicle specifications
- [ ] Navigation from vehicle list to individual vehicle details works seamlessly
- [ ] All vehicle data sections are well-organized and readable
- [ ] Component handles loading states and errors gracefully
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design maintains data readability and accessibility
- [ ] No console errors or warnings during normal operation
- [ ] Performance meets PRD requirements (page load < 3 seconds)
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- [ ] Theme system integration works correctly (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Task completed within 4 hours (half-day constraint)

## Notes and Considerations
This task builds directly on the successful Vehicle List Component implementation and provides the detailed vehicle information that users need after browsing the vehicle database. The scope is focused on displaying existing data in an organized, accessible format.

**Key constraints:**
- Must use existing VehicleService.getWithDetails() method
- Must follow established shadcn/ui design patterns
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing vehicle list navigation
- Must maintain mobile-first responsive design
- Must meet accessibility standards

**Future considerations:**
- Vehicle comparison features will build on this detailed view
- Advanced specifications and charts will enhance this foundation
- Real-time data updates can be added later
- Image galleries and media can be integrated in future tasks

## Example Usage
The VehicleDetail component will provide users with:

1. **Comprehensive Specifications**: Complete technical details organized in clear sections
2. **Performance Metrics**: Range, acceleration, top speed, and efficiency data
3. **Battery Information**: Capacity, charging specifications, and technology details
4. **Physical Specifications**: Dimensions, weight, cargo capacity, and seating
5. **Navigation**: Clear path back to vehicle list and related vehicles

Users will be able to access detailed vehicle information by clicking on vehicles from the list, view comprehensive specifications, and easily navigate back to browse other vehicles. This provides the detailed data experience central to the PRD's objectives.
