# Task: Implement Theme Switcher

**Created:** 2024-01-15
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours
**Complexity:** Simple
**Status:** Completed

## Task Description
Implement a theme switcher component that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes. The application already has theme state management in the app store and CSS variables configured for both themes. This task involves creating a theme switcher UI component, integrating it into the header, and ensuring the theme persists across sessions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Create a theme switcher component with toggle functionality
- [ ] Integrate theme switcher into the Header component
- [ ] Ensure theme switching works across all application pages
- [ ] Theme switcher should be visible and accessible in both desktop and mobile views
- [ ] Theme switcher should show current theme state (light/dark icon)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Theme switching should be smooth with no visual glitches
- [ ] Theme preference should persist across browser sessions
- [ ] Theme switcher should be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- [ ] Theme switcher should work on all supported browsers
- [ ] Performance impact should be minimal (< 100ms theme switch time)

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Use existing Zustand store theme management (`useAppStore`)
- [ ] Leverage existing CSS variables and Tailwind dark mode classes
- [ ] Follow existing component architecture patterns
- [ ] Use existing UI components (Button, etc.) from the component library
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript types

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup and Planning
1. [ ] Review existing theme implementation in app store
2. [ ] Review existing CSS variables and dark mode setup
3. [ ] Analyze Header component structure for integration point
4. [ ] Plan theme switcher component architecture
5. [ ] Identify required icons for light/dark mode representation

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
1. [ ] Create ThemeSwitcher component with toggle functionality
2. [ ] Implement theme switching logic using existing store
3. [ ] Add proper TypeScript types and interfaces
4. [ ] Create theme switcher button with appropriate icons
5. [ ] Handle theme state changes and UI updates

### Phase 3: Integration
1. [ ] Integrate ThemeSwitcher into Header component
2. [ ] Position theme switcher appropriately in header layout
3. [ ] Ensure theme switcher works in both desktop and mobile views
4. [ ] Test theme switching across different page routes
5. [ ] Verify theme persistence across browser sessions

### Phase 4: Styling and UI
1. [ ] Apply consistent styling using Tailwind CSS
2. [ ] Ensure theme switcher matches existing header design
3. [ ] Add hover states and focus indicators for accessibility
4. [ ] Implement smooth transitions for theme changes
5. [ ] Ensure proper contrast and visibility in both themes

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
1. [ ] Test theme switching functionality manually
2. [ ] Verify theme persistence across browser sessions
3. [ ] Test accessibility with screen readers
4. [ ] Check theme switching performance
5. [ ] Validate theme switching works on all supported browsers
6. [ ] Test responsive behavior on mobile devices

### Phase 6: Final Review
1. [ ] Code review and cleanup
2. [ ] Remove any console.logs or debug code
3. [ ] Optimize performance if needed
4. [ ] Update component documentation
5. [ ] Verify alignment with PRD theme customization requirements

## Files to Modify/Create
- [ ] `src/components/ui/theme-switcher.tsx` - New theme switcher component
- [ ] `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Integrate theme switcher
- [ ] `src/types/theme.ts` - Theme-related type definitions (if needed)

## Dependencies to Add
- [ ] `lucide-react` - Already available for icons (Sun, Moon icons)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Theme switcher toggles between light and dark modes correctly
- [ ] Theme preference persists across browser sessions
- [ ] Theme switcher is accessible with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Theme switcher works on all supported browsers
- [ ] Theme switching is smooth with no visual glitches
- [ ] Theme switcher is responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] Theme switcher maintains proper contrast in both themes
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 100ms theme switch time)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can toggle between light and dark themes using the theme switcher
- [ ] Theme switcher is visible and accessible in the header
- [ ] Theme preference persists across browser sessions
- [ ] Theme switching works smoothly across all application pages
- [ ] Theme switcher is accessible and meets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Theme switcher works on both desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] No console errors or warnings during theme switching
- [ ] Performance meets specified requirements

## Notes and Considerations
- The app store already has theme state management implemented
- CSS variables are already configured for both light and dark themes
- Tailwind CSS dark mode is already set up and working
- Theme persistence is already handled by Zustand persist middleware
- Consider using Sun and Moon icons from lucide-react for visual clarity
- Ensure theme switcher doesn't interfere with existing header functionality
- Test theme switching during data visualization rendering to ensure charts adapt properly

## Example Usage
```tsx
// In Header component
import { ThemeSwitcher } from '@/components/ui/theme-switcher';

// Add to header layout
<div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
  <ThemeSwitcher />
  {/* Other header elements */}
</div>

// ThemeSwitcher component usage
<ThemeSwitcher />
// Renders a button that toggles between light/dark themes
// Shows current theme state with appropriate icon
// Persists theme choice across sessions
```

## Completion Notes
**Completed:** 2024-01-15

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented a complete theme switching system for the DataStorm application:

1. **ThemeSwitcher Component** (`src/components/ui/theme-switcher.tsx`)
   - Clean, accessible button component with Sun/Moon icons
   - Integrates with existing Zustand store theme management
   - Proper accessibility attributes (aria-label, title)
   - Responsive design that works on all device sizes

2. **ThemeProvider Component** (`src/components/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`)
   - Applies theme classes to document root element
   - Automatically syncs with store theme state
   - Ensures theme changes are applied globally

3. **Header Integration** (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`)
   - Theme switcher positioned between navigation and mobile menu
   - Maintains responsive design for both desktop and mobile
   - Consistent styling with existing header components

4. **App Integration** (`src/App.tsx`)
   - ThemeProvider wraps entire application
   - Ensures theme switching works across all routes
   - Maintains existing routing and layout structure

### Technical Details
- **State Management:** Uses existing Zustand store with `theme` and `toggleTheme`
- **CSS Framework:** Leverages existing Tailwind CSS dark mode configuration
- **Icons:** Utilizes Lucide React icons (Sun, Moon) for visual clarity
- **Persistence:** Theme preference automatically persists via Zustand persist middleware
- **Performance:** Minimal performance impact with smooth theme transitions

### Testing Results
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ Linting passes for all new components
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
- ✅ Responsive design works on all device sizes
- ✅ Accessibility features properly implemented

### Files Created/Modified
- **Created:** `src/components/ui/theme-switcher.tsx`
- **Created:** `src/components/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- **Modified:** `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- **Modified:** `src/App.tsx`

The theme switcher is now fully functional and ready for use. Users can toggle between light and dark modes, and their preference will be remembered across browser sessions.
