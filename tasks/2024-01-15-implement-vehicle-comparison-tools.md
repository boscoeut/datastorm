# Task: Implement Vehicle Comparison Tools

**Created:** 2024-01-15  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Implement side-by-side vehicle comparison functionality allowing users to compare multiple vehicles across specifications  
**Phase:** Phase 1  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Dependencies:** Vehicle List Component, Vehicle Detail Component, Vehicle Specification Table

## Requirements
### Functional
- [ ] Allow users to select 2-4 vehicles for comparison
- [ ] Display vehicles side-by-side in a comparison table
- [ ] Show key specifications for each vehicle in parallel columns
- [ ] Enable adding/removing vehicles from comparison
- [ ] Provide clear visual indicators for differences between vehicles
- [ ] Support responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Technical
- [ ] Create VehicleComparison component using React + TypeScript
- [ ] Integrate with existing vehicle store and data structures
- [ ] Use TanStack Table for comparison display
- [ ] Implement responsive grid layout with Tailwind CSS

- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Implementation Steps

### Setup & Planning (30 min)
1. [ ] Review project status and documentation
2. [ ] Analyze existing vehicle components and data structures
3. [ ] Plan comparison component architecture
4. [ ] Design comparison table layout and responsive behavior

### Core Implementation (2.5 hours)
1. [ ] Create VehicleComparison component with TypeScript interfaces
2. [ ] Implement vehicle selection and comparison logic
3. [ ] Create comparison table using TanStack Table
4. [ ] Add comparison state management to vehicle store
5. [ ] Implement add/remove vehicle functionality
6. [ ] Handle edge cases and error states

### Integration (30 min)
1. [ ] Integrate with existing vehicle components
2. [ ] Add comparison button to VehicleList component
3. [ ] Update vehicle store with comparison functionality
4. [ ] Verify data flow and state management

### Styling & UI (30 min)
1. [ ] Apply Tailwind CSS styling for comparison layout
2. [ ] Implement responsive grid design
3. [ ] Add visual indicators for specification differences
4. [ ] Ensure accessibility and keyboard navigation

### Testing & Validation (15 min)
1. [ ] Test comparison functionality manually
2. [ ] Verify responsive behavior across device sizes
3. [ ] Check for console errors and accessibility issues
4. [ ] Validate against requirements

### Final Review (15 min)
1. [ ] Code review and cleanup
2. [ ] Remove debug code and optimize performance
3. [ ] Update taskList.md when complete
4. [ ] Document component usage and props

## Files to Modify/Create
**Maximum 2 files per 4-hour task:**
- [ ] `src/components/vehicles/VehicleComparison.tsx` - Main comparison component
- [ ] `src/stores/vehicle-store.ts` - Add comparison state management

## Dependencies to Add
- [ ] No new dependencies required - using existing TanStack Table

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Builds successfully
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] No runtime errors
- [ ] Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- [ ] Comparison table displays correctly
- [ ] Vehicle selection works properly
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can select 2-4 vehicles for comparison
- [ ] Comparison table displays vehicles side-by-side with specifications
- [ ] Visual indicators highlight differences between vehicles
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Integration with existing vehicle components works seamlessly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (fast loading, smooth interactions)
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- [ ] Task completed within 4 hours

## Notes and Considerations
This task builds upon the existing vehicle infrastructure and should integrate seamlessly with the current vehicle list and detail components. The comparison tool should follow the project's data-centric design philosophy, maximizing information display while maintaining usability. Consider using color coding or icons to highlight specification differences for better user experience.

## Example Usage
Users can click a "Compare" button on vehicle list items to add them to a comparison. The comparison view shows selected vehicles in parallel columns with specifications aligned for easy comparison. Users can add/remove vehicles and see highlighted differences in key metrics like range, power, and acceleration.
