## Notes and Considerations

### Task Breakdown Strategy
**Vehicle Database Core Functionality has been broken down into 4-hour tasks:**
- **Task 1.1**: Vehicle List Component - Foundation component for displaying vehicle data âœ… Completed
- **Task 1.2**: Vehicle Detail Component - Individual vehicle specification display âœ… Completed
- **Task 1.3**: Vehicle Search and Filtering - Advanced search and filter capabilities
- **Task 1.4**: Vehicle Components Integration - Final integration and testing

**Task Files Created:**
- `tasks/2024-01-15-implement-vehicle-list-component.md` - Completed âœ…
- `tasks/2024-01-15-implement-vehicle-detail-component.md` - Completed âœ…

This breakdown ensures each task is completable in half a day while maintaining development velocity and providing incremental user value.

### Technical Debt
- Current placeholder pages need to be replaced with real implementations
- Database test component should be removed in production
- Some TypeScript types may need refinement as features are implemented

### Performance Considerations
- All components must meet PRD performance requirements (< 3s load time)
- Data visualization components should be optimized for large datasets
- Mobile performance is critical for user experience

### Accessibility Requirements
- All new components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Data visualizations must be accessible to screen readers
- Mobile interfaces must support touch and keyboard navigation

---

**Next Action**: Begin implementation of Task #1 (Vehicle Database Core Functionality) as it is the foundation for all other features and has no dependencies.
