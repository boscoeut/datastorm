2. [ ] Connect search state to vehicle-store.ts for data filtering
3. [ ] Ensure proper data flow between search and list components
4. [ ] Test integration with existing vehicle display functionality

### Phase 4: Styling and UI (30 minutes)
1. [ ] Apply consistent styling using Tailwind CSS and design system
2. [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
3. [ ] Add loading states and smooth transitions
4. [ ] Ensure theme compatibility (light/dark mode support)
5. [ ] Implement accessibility features and ARIA labels

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation (15 minutes)
1. [ ] Test search functionality with various input scenarios
2. [ ] Verify filter combinations work correctly
3. [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
4. [ ] Validate accessibility with screen reader testing
5. [ ] Check performance meets 500ms response time requirement

### Phase 6: Final Review (15 minutes)
1. [ ] Code review and cleanup following project standards
2. [ ] Remove debug code and console.logs
3. [ ] Optimize performance and ensure smooth interactions
4. [ ] Update component documentation and comments
5. [ ] Verify alignment with PRD requirements and technical specs

## Files to Modify/Create
**Maximum 2 files per 4-hour task:**
- [ ] `src/components/vehicles/VehicleSearch.tsx` - Main search and filter component
- [ ] `src/components/vehicles/VehicleList.tsx` - Integrate search functionality

## Dependencies to Add
- [ ] No new dependencies required - using existing approved tech stack

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Search input responds to user typing with real-time filtering
- [ ] Filter controls properly filter vehicle data by selected criteria
- [ ] Search results update correctly when filters change
- [ ] Reset functionality clears all filters and shows all vehicles
- [ ] Component is responsive on mobile and desktop devices
- [ ] Performance meets 500ms response time requirement
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Integration with VehicleList component works seamlessly
- [ ] Theme switching maintains proper styling and functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can search vehicles by typing in search input field
- [ ] Filter controls allow filtering by make, model, price, battery, and performance
- [ ] Search results update in real-time as user types or changes filters
- [ ] Filter state is clearly displayed with option to reset all filters
- [ ] Component integrates seamlessly with existing VehicleList component
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design maintains usability on small screens
- [ ] Performance meets 500ms response time requirement
- [ ] Accessibility standards are maintained (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Theme switching works correctly with search component
- [ ] No console errors or performance issues

## Notes and Considerations
- Build on existing vehicle-store.ts patterns for state management
- Use existing vehicle data structure and types
- Ensure search component follows established component architecture
- Maintain consistency with existing UI patterns and design system
- Consider performance implications of real-time filtering on large datasets

## Example Usage
```tsx
// VehicleSearch component will be used like this:
<VehicleSearch 
  onSearchChange={handleSearchChange}
  onFilterChange={handleFilterChange}
  filters={currentFilters}
  searchQuery={searchQuery}
/>
```
