3. [ ] Optimize performance and ensure smooth interactions
4. [ ] Update documentation and component comments
5. [ ] Verify alignment with PRD requirements and technical specs

## Files to Modify/Create
**Maximum 2 files per 4-hour task:**
- [ ] `src/pages/VehiclesPage.tsx` - Main vehicles page that integrates all components
- [ ] `src/App.tsx` - Update routing to use new VehiclesPage component

## Dependencies to Add
- [ ] No new dependencies required - using existing approved tech stack

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Users can navigate from home page to vehicles page
- [ ] Search and filtering works correctly on vehicles page
- [ ] Users can click on vehicles to view details
- [ ] Navigation back to list works properly
- [ ] All components maintain proper state across navigation
- [ ] Error handling works correctly across all components
- [ ] Loading states provide good user feedback
- [ ] Performance meets PRD requirements (< 3s load time)
- [ ] Accessibility standards are maintained across all views
- [ ] Theme switching works consistently across all components

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] VehiclesPage component integrates all vehicle functionality seamlessly
- [ ] Users can complete the full flow: search → filter → list → detail → back
- [ ] All components work together without conflicts or errors
- [ ] Navigation is smooth and intuitive between all views
- [ ] Performance meets PRD requirements for load times
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback to users
- [ ] Loading states give appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Responsive design works on all device sizes
- [ ] Theme switching works consistently across all components
- [ ] No console errors or performance issues
- [ ] Accessibility standards are maintained throughout

## Notes and Considerations
- Build on existing routing structure in App.tsx
- Ensure consistent state management across all components
- Maintain existing error handling and loading patterns
- Consider user experience flow from search to detail view
- Test edge cases like network errors and empty states

## Example Usage
```tsx
// VehiclesPage will be used like this in App.tsx:
<Route path="/vehicles" element={<VehiclesPage />} />

// And will integrate all vehicle components:
<VehiclesPage>
  <VehicleSearch />
  <VehicleList />
  {/* Navigation to VehicleDetail handled by routing */}
</VehiclesPage>
```
