# AI Instruction: Be Judicious with Tokens

- **Prioritize brevity and clarity.** Your responses should be as concise as possible while still being comprehensive.
- **Focus only on the provided context.** Do not bring in outside information or files unless explicitly asked.
- **When generating code, only produce what is necessary to solve the immediate problem.** Avoid adding extra features or verbose comments.
- **Summarize your understanding before acting.** Briefly state your plan of action before generating code or making changes. This ensures you are on the right track without wasting tokens on incorrect assumptions.
